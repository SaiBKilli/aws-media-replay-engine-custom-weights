# Developers Guide - Extending MRE Functionality

While MRE provides many features that help establish an automated live video processing solution, there may be needs to extend the framework to accomplish unique needs. One way to do this is with the custom events that are generated by MRE and made available via the AWS Event Bridge service.

The following Event Bridge message topics are currently supported:
- Event start
- Segment start detected
- Segment end detected
- Optimized Segment start detected
- Optimized Segment end detected
- Segment cached
- Optimized Segment cached
- Replay calculated
- Segment preview - thumbs up
- Segment preview - thumbs down
- Event completed

Attaching custom AWS Lambda functions to these events allows for extra processing to occur event-based (just in time).

Examples where these events can be applied are:
- Export the list of segments found for an event as the live event occurs
- Export an entire event list at the completion of the event and import into an existing media management solution to provide valuable tags in editing workflows
- Add the video segment that was not segmented correctly to an A2I or AWS Sagemaker Ground Truth pipeline for review and labeling in a ML process
